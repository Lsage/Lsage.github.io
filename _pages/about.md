Currently, I'm leading an R&D team to conduct ML research and build products for financial services. At the moment, my group focuses on NLP. But my research interest is quite broad, and my past works cover a few sub-areas of ML, CV, and NLP. I obtained my Ph.D. under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/">David J. Fleet</a> and <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/">Aaron Hertzmann</a> at the University of Toronto. 

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
