Currently, I'm leading an R&D team to conduct ML research and build products for financial services. At the moment, my group focuses on NLP. But my research interest is quite broad, and my past works cover a few sub-areas of ML, CV, and NLP. I obtained my Ph.D. under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/">David J. Fleet</a> and <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/">Aaron Hertzmann</a> at the University of Toronto.
