Currently, I'm leading an R&D team to conduct machine learning research and build products for financial services. My group focuses on natural language processing, but my research interest is quite broad, with works in a few sub-areas of machine learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I obtained my Ph.D. under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/">David J. Fleet</a> and <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/">Aaron Hertzmann</a> at the University of Toronto.
