Currently I lead an R&D team to conduct research and build products for financial services. I have worked on a range of topics across deep learning, generative models, adversarial machine learning, NLP and computer vision. I obtained my Ph.D. under <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fleet/">David J. Fleet</a> and <a href="https://www.dgp.toronto.edu/~hertzman/">Aaron Hertzmann</a> at the University of Toronto.
