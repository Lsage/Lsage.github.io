We are presenting the following 4 papers at [ACL 2021](https://2021.aclweb.org/):

- [Optimizing Deeper Transformers on Small Datasets (main conference track)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.163/)
- [Code Generation from Natural Language with Less Prior Knowledge and More Monolingual Data (main conference track)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-short.98/)
- [TURING: an Accurate and Interpretable Multi-Hypothesis Cross-Domain Natural Language Database Interface (demo track)](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-demo.36/)
- [A Globally Normalized Neural Model for Semantic Parsing (Proceedings of the 5th Workshop on Structured Prediction for NLP (SPNLP 2021))](https://aclanthology.org/2021.spnlp-1.7/)

These four papers highlight some of our works from last year on precise sentence level semantics. A common theme here is on solving hard NLU problems when high quality labelled data is scarce.
