title: Why is Cross-Domain Text-to-SQL Hard?

description: An introduction to cross-domain text-to-SQL semantic parsing
---

I wrote a blog about cross-domain text-to-SQL, discussing why it is an interesting and hard problem, and one way to approach it. Here's a quote:
<blockquote>
[...] successful cross-database SQL semantic parsing really requires the model to reason using at least three sets of knowledge:
<ul>
    <li>Explicit knowledge about the domain expressed in the schema;</li>
    <li>Implicit background or common sense knowledge;</li>
    <li>Knowledge of SQL.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
